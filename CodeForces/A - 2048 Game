# Problem description: https://codeforces.com/contest/1221/problem/A
# You are playing a variation of game 2048. Initially you have a multiset `s`
# of `n` integers. Every integer in this multiset is a power of two.
#
# You may perform any number (possibly, zero) operations with this multiset.
#
# During each operation you choose two equal integers from `s`, remove them from `s`
# and insert the number equal to their sum into `s`.
#
# You win if the number 2048 belongs to your multiset. For example, if `s={1024,512,512,4}`
# you can win as follows: choose 512 and 512, your multiset turns into {1024,1024,4}.
# Then choose 1024 and 1024, your multiset turns into {2048,4} and you win.
#
# You have to determine if you can win this game.
#
# You have to answer `q` independent queries.
#
# Input:
# The first line contains one integer `q` (1 ≤ q ≤ 100) – the number of queries.
# The first line of each query contains one integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in multiset.
# The second line of each query contains `n` integers `s1, s2, …, sn` (1 ≤ si ≤ 2^29) — the description of the multiset.
# It is guaranteed that all elements of the multiset are powers of two.
#
# Output:
# For each query print "YES" if it is possible to obtain the number 2048 in your multiset,
# and "NO" otherwise.

def main():
    q = int(input())  # Read number of queries
    for _ in range(q):

        blocks = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the multiset
        count = {2**i: 0 for i in range(11)}  # We care about powers of two from 2^0 to 2^11 (up to 2048)

        # Count occurrences of each power of two
        for block in blocks:
            count[block] += 1

        # Try to combine blocks starting from the smallest power of two
        for i in range(11):  # From 2^0 to 2^10 (which covers up to 1024)
            if count[2**i] >= 2:
                # Combine blocks into the next higher power of two
                count[2**(i+1)] += count[2**i] // 2
                count[2**i] %= 2
